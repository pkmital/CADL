    "This first homework assignment will guide you through working with a small dataset of images.  For Part 1, you'll need to find 100 images and use the function I've provided to create a montage of your images, saving it to the file \"dataset.png\" (template code provided below).  You can load an existing dataset of images, find your own images, or perhaps create your own images using a creative process such as painting, photography, or something along those lines.  Each image will be reshaped to 100 x 100 pixels.  There needs to be at least 100 images.  For Parts 2 and 3, you'll then calculate the mean and deviation of it using a tensorflow session. In Part 4,  you'll normalize your dataset using the mean and deviation.  Then in Part 5, you will convolve your normalized dataset.  For Part 6, you'll need to sort the entire convolved dataset.  Finally, the last part will package everything for you in a zip file which you can upload to Kadenze to get assessed (only if you are a Kadenze Premium member, $10 p/m, free for the first month).  Remember to complete the additional excercises online, including the Gallery participation and the Forum post.  If you have any questions, be sure to enroll in the course and ask your peers in the \\#CADL community or me on the forums!\n",

It is only 100 images after all, not a whole lot for a computer to reason about and learn something meaningful.  So <b>think about creating a *dataset* of images that could possibly reveal something fundamental about what is contained in the images</b>.  Try to think about creating a set of images that represents something.  For instance, this might be images of yourself over time.  Or it might be every picture you've ever taken of your cat.  Or perhaps the view from your room at different times of the day.  Consider making the changes within each image as significant as possible.  As \"representative\" of the thing you want to capture as possible.  Hopefully by the end of this lesson, you'll understand a little better the difference between what a computer thinks is significant and what you yourself thought was significant.\n",

    "Once you have seen the mean image of your dataset, how does it relate to your own expectations of the dataset?  Did you expect something different?  Was there something more \"regular\" or \"predictable\" about your dataset that the mean image did or did not reveal?  If your mean image looks a lot like something recognizable, it's a good sign that there is a lot of predictability in your dataset.  If your mean image looks like nothing at all, a gray blob where not much seems to stand out, then it's pretty likely that there isn't very much in common between your images.  Neither is a bad scenario.  Though, it is more likely that having some predictability in your mean image, e.g. something recognizable, that there are representations worth exploring with deeper networks capable of representing them.

This will be a little more involved as there is no operation in tensorflow to do this for you.  However, you can do this by calculating the mean image of your dataset as a 4-D array.  To do this, you could write e.g.  `mean_img_4d = tf.reduce_mean(imgs, reduction_indices=0, keep_dims=True)` to give you a `1 x H x W x C` dimension array calculated on the `N x H x W x C` images variable.  The reduction_indices parameter is saying to calculate the mean over the 0th dimension, meaning for every possible `H`, `W`, `C`, or for every pixel, you will have a mean composed over the `N` possible values it could have had, or what that pixel was for every possible image.  This way, you can write `images - mean_img_4d` to give you a `N x H x W x C` dimension variable, with every image in your images array having been subtracted by the `mean_img_4d`.  If you calculate the square root of the sum of the squared differences of this resulting operation, you have your standard deviation!\n",

    "What we've just done is build a \"hand-crafted\" feature detector: the Gabor Kernel.  This kernel is built to respond to particular orientation: horizontal edges, and a particular scale.  It also responds equally to R, G, and B color channels, as that is how we have told the convolve operation to work: use the same kernel for every input color channel.  When we work with deep networks, we'll see how we can *learn* the convolution kernels for every color channel, and learn many more of them, in the order of 100s per color channel.  That is really where the power of deep networks will start to become obvious.  For now, we've seen just how difficult it is to get at any higher order features of the dataset.  We've really only picked out some edges!\n",
