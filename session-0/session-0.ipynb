    "This preliminary session will cover the basics of working with image data in Python, and creating an image dataset.  Please make sure you are running at least Python 3.4 and have Tensorflow 0.9.0 or higher installed.  If you are unsure of how to do this, please make sure you have followed the [installation instructions](../README.md#installation-preliminaries).  We'll also cover loading images from a directory, resizing and cropping images, and changing an image datatype from unsigned int to float32.  If you feel comfortable with all of this, please feel free to skip straight to Session 1.  Otherwise, launch `jupyter notebook` and make sure you are reading the `session-0.ipynb` file. \n",

For images this means we'll need to crop the images while trying not to remove any of the important information in it.  Most image datasets that you'll find online will already have a standard size for every image.  But if you're creating your own dataset, you'll need to know how to make all the images the same size.  One way to do this is to find the longest edge of the image, and crop this edge to be as long as the shortest edge of the image.  This will convert the image to a square one, meaning its sides will be the same lengths.  The reason for doing this is that we can then resize this square image to any size we'd like, without distorting the image.  Let's see how we can do that:"

    "There are a few things going on here.  First, we are defining a function which takes as input a single variable.  This variable gets named `img` inside the function, and we enter a set of if/else-if conditionals.  The first branch says, if the rows of `img` are greater than the columns, then set the variable `extra` to their difference and divide by 2.  The `//` notation means to perform an integer division, instead of a floating point division.  So `3 // 2 = 1`, not 1.5.  We need integers for the next line of code which says to set the variable `crop` to `img` starting from `extra` rows, and ending at negative `extra` rows down.  We can't be on row 1.5, only row 1 or 2.  So that's why we need the integer divide there.  Let's say our image was 128 x 96 x 3.  We would have `extra = (128 - 96) // 2`, or 16.  Then we'd start from the 16th row, and end at the -16th row, or the 112th row.  That adds up to 96 rows, exactly the same number of columns as we have.\n",
